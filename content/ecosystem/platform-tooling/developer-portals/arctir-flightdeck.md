### A brief history of Arctir

Arctir was founded in 2022 by veterans of the cloud native and developer tooling companies, including Heptio, VMware, Red Hat, Kong and others. Developers are buried in complexity, but traditional tools, like wikis and spreadsheets, only compound the problem. Having witnessed, first hand, the pain that developers endure from misaligned or non-existent tools, we are focused on delivering real, lasting solutions that help developers make sense of their complete software estate.
