### **What is Rely.io?**

[Rely.io](https://rely.io) is an **Internal Developer Portal** that aims to improve developer autonomy, reduce costs and ultimately increase developer productivity all while ensuring governance and standardization.

Rely.io is opinionated enough so you can see value in minutes and highly flexible to support any use case and tech stack that customers might have.

Starting with the Software Catalog, Rely.io covers microservices, teams, incidents, cloud resources, etc. To allow you to leverage your existing data model you can create custom assets and use Rely.io's REST API to import your data.

Blueprints are a foundational concept for Rely.io. They are the representation of any resource, such as services, incidents, environment, cloud resources, etc. When you create an account with Rely.io you get several blueprints by default but as part or Rely.io's extensability features you can adapt the existing blueprints or create your own.

Building on top of the Software Catalog and Blueprints Rely.io offers Scorecards that allow teams to track specific metrics and KPIs that are relevant to them. Scorecards are calculated dynamically and implement gamification features that create some healthy competition between teams.

To improve developer autonomy and reduce ticket-ops, Rely.io provides Self-service capabilities to developers through its Self-service hub. By default, Rely.io offers certain Self-service actions by default but you can customize the Self-service actions and create your own.

Lastly, Rely.io aims to be a central component to the day-to-day of developers. With that in mind, Rely.io, created developer homepages that you can customize to adapt to your daily tasks.
