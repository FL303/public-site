### What is the mission and vision of Tempest?

Tempest’s mission is to create the space for innovation at the world’s most important organizations. By delivering products that enable cohesive, collaborative, and secure developer experiences, Tempest empowers engineering teams to focus on what matters most—building and innovating—while eliminating the friction of managing complex infrastructure.

### A brief history of Tempest

Tempest was founded by the team behind Fleetsmith, acquired by Apple in 2020. After years at Apple, the founders recognized a recurring challenge: engineering teams that are burdened with infrastructure and operational tasks are less innovative. Launched in 2024, Tempest builds on their experience to address this gap.
