### What is Massdriver?

Massdriver is a visual development environment that enables teams to quickly design internal developer platform (IDP) that facilitates the deployment of production-ready cloud infrastructure and applications in minutes. It acts as a bridge between developers and operations teams, providing a collaborative platform to design, scale, automate, and observe robust cloud architectures effortlessly.

### What is the mission and vision of Massdriver?

Massdriver aims to fulfill the promise of the cloud by providing scalability, agility, and ease of use akin to a Platform as a Service (PaaS), without compromising on flexibility and control. It envisions to become a go-to platform for teams looking to accelerate cloud-native application development and deployment while ensuring security and compliance.

### A brief history of Massdriver

Founded in 2021 by Cory O'Daniel, David Williams, and Chris Hill, Massdriver started with a mission to simplify cloud infrastructure management and DevOps processes, allowing teams to focus on building great products. Massdriver is backed by Y Combinator and raised an [$8 million dollar](https://blog.massdriver.cloud/posts/announcing-our-series-seed-round/) seed round from Builders VC in June of 2023.
