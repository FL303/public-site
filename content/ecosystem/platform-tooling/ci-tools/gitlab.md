# GitLab

GitLab is one application with endless possibilities. Organizations rely on GitLabâ€™s source code management, Continuous Integration, Continous Delivery, and Deployment (referred to as CI/CD), security, and more to deliver software rapidly. GitLab is growing rapidly, although some say it's spread slightly too thin across all layers. But Continuous Integration and version control are what they live and breathe.
