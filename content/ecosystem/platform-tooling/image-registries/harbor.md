# Harbor

Harbor is an open source registry that secures artifacts with policies and Role-Based Access Control. It ensures images are scanned and free from vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted. Harbor is a graduate of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It delivers compliance, performance, and interoperability to help you consistently and securely manage artifacts across cloud-native compute platforms like Kubernetes and Docker. Harbor is what we are seeing used most in the Internal Developer Platform ecosystem.
