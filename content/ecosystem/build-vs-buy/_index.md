# Build vs. buy

_When should you consider building your own Internal Developer Platform (IDP)? Are there shortcuts you can take?_

Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) always have to be tailored to the needs of the specific company. In a real sense, it's not possible to buy a ready-made IDP off-the-shelf. They always have to be customized to your specific delivery needs. There are two approaches teams take when they want to get an Internal Developer Platform.

## Off-the-shelf frameworks for building Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)

The easiest way to get started is by using an existing off-the-shelf framework as starting point. Obviously, you still have to connect it to your infrastructure, configure it, and maybe even enhance it to incorporate that one very unique piece of infrastructure in your setup. However, depending on which framework you are choosing, many or even all of the [5 Core Components]({{< relref "core-components" >}}) are readily available. The best frameworks offer a state-of-the-art user interface (UI), a command-line interface (CLI), and an API to match all personal preferences in your teams. Don't forget: it's all about the developer experience.
