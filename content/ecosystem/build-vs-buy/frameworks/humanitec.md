### What is Humanitec?
 
Humanitec describes itself as “a platform API to do the heavy lifting of RBAC, Infrastructure Orchestration, Configuration Management, and more.”
 
Humanitec enables organisations to build their own Internal Developer Platform that harnesses learning from developing platforms for Google and makes them available for the general public. It is a flexible, highly-customizable product that connects other tools and infrastructure components to enable end-to-end self-service.
 
Humanitec offers the broadest coverage of integrations compared to other tools on the market through its open-source drivers or the capability to use any Infrastructure as Code (IaC) script. Many adopt Humanitec because of its overall extensibility, and developers can use the API, UI or CLI to self-serve all the tech they need.
 
With Humanitec, operation teams can define golden paths for developer self-service and overcome ticket ops. This allows developers to spin up fully provisioned environments on demand and deploy apps independently. An IDP built with Humanitec serves to increase deployment frequency and reduce lead time.
 
The most significant setback with the current version of Humanitec is that the documentation needs improvement. Given the fast growing functionalities, some parts seem to be missing in the docs.
 
## What is the mission and vision of Humanitec?
 
Humanitec has four fundamental product principles: integrate & embrace, openness, zero lock-ins, and following industry conventions.
 
Through the integrate and embrace strategy, Humanitec is designed to effortlessly work with any CI, any cloud (also multi-cloud), any IaC and other tools such as Backstage, Argo, meeting the variability of an enterprise-level infrastructure setup.
 
Openness pledges that developers of any skill level can effectively use the platform to “fight the scripting hell.”
 
With the promise of zero lock-ins, Humanitec releases users from dependency on a vendor for products or services.
 
And since Humanitec doesn’t believe in reinventing the wheel, they adhere to industry standards to streamline IDP development.
 
## A brief history of Humanitec
 
Humanitec is a VC-financed company created to make IDP building easier. It was crafted by a team of developers who worked on Google’s IDP and wanted to share what they learned with the general public.
 
## Core features of Humanitec
 
Humanitec’s core component is the Platform API, which does the heavy lifting for RBAC, infrastructure orchestration, app config management, and deployment automation. As the it’s nucleus, the API enables developers to request fresh environments, resources like databases, DNS, storage and more without writing scripts or filing operations tickets.
 
The platform integrates with whichever CI pipeline. Humanitec also promises that operation teams can incorporate just about any tool or workflow (incl. GitOps & IaC) they want to use for their IDP through the system’s open source driver library. Alternatively, engineers can build a custom driver.
 
Humanitec’s API, CLI and UI offer different kinds of abstraction layers, but also the ability to define baseline configurations in plain YAML.

Definition and configuration capabilities for operations teams include:
- Definition of baseline configurations
- Role Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Infrastructure orchestration
- Definition of resource dependencies (e.g., which kind of environments should be equipped with which kind of infrastructure)


Self-service capabilities for engineering teams include:
- Creation of fully provisioned environments with a single command
- Service creation (workloads, default configs and depending resources)
- Resource provisioning (databases, file-storage, DNS and clusters)
- Automated deployments (git-push deploy)
- Instant rollbacks
- Full visibility which services are running in which state in which environments
