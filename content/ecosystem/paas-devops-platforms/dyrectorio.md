## What is dyrector.io?

dyrector.io is an open-source container management platform that helps you with self-service OCI image configuration and deployment capabilities.

### Who is it for?

- **DevOps Engineers / System Admins** - The platform can be used as a hub where your team can interact with your infrastructure without your presence.
- **Software Engineers / Developers** - You can spend more time creating new features instead of manually going through steps of deploying your containerized stack repeatedly.
- **Indie hackers / Self-hosters** - You can use the platform by installing the agent of the platform on your infrastructure instead of setting up a dashboard and individually adding all the applications you host for yourself.
- **Startups / Organizations afraid of vendor lock-ins** - If you're a startupper or the decision-maker of an organization, you can check out the platform as a developer platform that fits your infrastructure as long as you manage OCI images.

### Use cases

#### Self-service container management

Deploy, start, restart, stop, delete containers on your infrastructure. Check logs and inspect containers when you need to.

#### Self-hosted stacks for indie hackers

Set up containerized stacks on any environment and manage your entire ecosystem via a GUI.

#### Multi-instance deployments

When you create business applications, configure releases and deploy them to as many environments as you need them to with one click.

#### Instant test environments

When you develop applications as a member of a team, your QA or sales teammates can set up the stack for themselves without your presence.

### What makes it special?

#### UI & API for Kubernetes and Docker

The platform substitutes container management with commands in Kubernetes and Docker with a UI. If you'd like to build something new that involves interactions with these technologies, you can do so by using the platform's [API](https://docs.dyrector.io/basics/api).

#### Cloud provider & technology agnostic

Any environment is ready to be used with the platform with minimal effort, no need to set up your stack on an entirely new infrastructure. Get instant results with the platform.

#### Wide-range of integrations

You can manage any OCI image available in any V2 compatible registry, for example Docker Hub, GitLab, GitHub, Google or Azure container registries.
Chat notifications are also available in Slack, Discord and MS Teams. Popular containerized projects, such as WordPress and Strapi are also available as preset applications, ready for deployments with minimal configuration changes.

#### Product Owners, Project Managers, Stakeholders

Stakeholders have access to Product information, but they canâ€™t execute any actions regarding them.
