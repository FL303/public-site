## What is Pergola?

As an end-to-end self-service platform for developers, Pergola simplifies the creation, deployment, execution and management of software products as a service. It enables developers to focus on their work and turn ideas into great products without losing time on the technical infrastructure and operations.

With Pergola, you have full control over the entire process, from building to deploying and serving your applications to your users, without any of the IT complexity.

No need to set up and administer servers or clusters. Never again worry about patching, firewalls, scalability or availability. Simply focus on your use-cases, work with the technologies and frameworks you know and love. Pergola does all the nerdy magic for you.
