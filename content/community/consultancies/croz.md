# CROZ

There are a lot of challenges and risks in building the appropriate digital platform, one that best fits an organization. 

Finding the right balance can be very challenging. Should the platform be built or bought, is your current platform struggling to float due to excessive weight (lacking buoyancy), are you building the right thing… many more questions can come up.

With our years of experience and many effective platforms we’ve helped to build, we are more than capable of helping you understand and answer those questions by applying Platform Engineering principles and viewing the platform as a product – a platform that should continuously evolve and enable fast flow of value.
