# axem

Here at [axem](https://axemsolutions.io/), we are dedicated to helping individuals and businesses 
create a productive and enjoyable embedded development experience. We provide services to build and 
manage the whole development infrastructure by the power of DevOps methodologies combined with our 
expertise in embedded systems. We create consistant and scalable customized Development Environments 
that enable the developers to solely focus on their tasks. Our solutions are specifically tailored 
for tools used in the embedded industry, covering the developer's PC and the CI/CD server. Our main 
goal is to create and share better, accelerated embedded solutions, to get back the lost time and 
effort. We have no intention of reinventing the wheel, but we want it to go as smooth as possible.

## DEM

We are building a tool called [Development Environment Manager (DEM)](https://axemsolutions.io/dem_doc/), which provides a convinient way
for developers to set up the right tooling for a project. The DEM is designed to act as the core 
element of an IDP.
